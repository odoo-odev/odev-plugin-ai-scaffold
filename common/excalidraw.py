"""Export the Excalidraw diagrams a task links to, as SVGs the agent can read.

A diagram is a live document: there is no url that hands back a picture, so the only
way to get one is to open the board in a browser and drive its own export. That is what
Playwright is here for, and it is the slowest thing in a run - a browser launch, a wait
for the scene to settle, then the export dialog - hence the spinner.

Two kinds of board, because a link decides which editor opens. A share link opens the
editor itself, which has the export dialog. An Excalidraw+ read-only link opens a viewer
that has no menu at all - only a zoom - so there is no dialog to drive: that page ships
the whole scene in its own html, and the fix is to read it from there and hand it to
excalidraw.com, which does have the dialog. See :func:`_readonly_scene`.

SVG rather than PNG, because the agent reads a diagram far better that way: the export
keeps every label of the board as text and every box as a shape with coordinates, so the
model reads the names of the models and the arrows between them instead of inferring
them from pixels. It is the same dialog and the same cost, and an SVG stays legible at
any zoom for the human who opens the artifact afterwards.

Nothing here writes to stdout but the one question it has to ask. The browser is chatty
by nature and every step of it is a debug detail: on a normal run the user sees a
spinner, and with ``--log-level debug`` they see why the export took as long as it did,
or where it gave up. The exception is a board that will not open for a browser signed in
to nothing - a private Excalidraw+ one - which is asked for by hand while the developer
is still at the terminal. See :func:`_ask_for_exports`.
